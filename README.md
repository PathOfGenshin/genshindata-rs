# genshindata-rs

A strongly-typed Rust based library wrapper for
[GenshinData](https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData) JSON files.

Uses [quicktype](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype) to generate `serde` compatible
Rust structs.

## Development

Note that this is still a work-in-progress. Currently only generates serde structs for
`ExcelBinOutput` JSON files.

Currently updated for game version: **3.1.0**

A strongly-typed Rust based library wrapper for game resource JSON files.

Uses [quicktype](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype) to generate `serde` compatible
Rust structs.

## Development

Note that this is still a work-in-progress. Currently only generates serde structs for
`ExcelBinOutput` JSON files.

### Generating `serde` structs from JSON

Ensure that `pnpm` and a `node` environment is installed (tested on `node v20.4.0`).

1. `pnpm install` to install the node dependencies needed to generate Rust code.
2. Ensure that the `EXCEL_BIN_OUTPUT_FOLDER` environment variable is set to the path
   containing the game's JSON `ExcelBinOutput` resource folder (we don't provide that
   here, you'll have to get that yourself). If not set, this defaults to `../AnimeGameData/ExcelBinOutput`
3. `pnpm generate` to generate the Rust `serde` structs code.
4. Double-check generated `.rs` files in `genshindata-rs/src/excelbinoutput/`
